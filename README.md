# Hojicha
This project is a first effort at developing an operating system for the i386 platform. Thanks for checking it out!

> Caution: Hojicha is _very much_ a work in progress. It is very incomplete, and likely has many bugs. _Please do not_
> try to install it on real hardware - I'm not responsible for what happens if you do.

## Current Status
Under active (early) development. The next big hurdle is interrupts and getting keyboard input.

If you're reading this and you have feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know!

#### TODO:
Build and run instructions, proper readme stuff
